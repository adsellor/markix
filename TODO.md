# TODO

- [ ] Add responsive resize to canvas.
- [ ] Add more efficient diff patching for the updates.
- [ ] Decrease memory footprint (remove memcpy and friends).
- [ ] Add Secondary buffer support, maybe use native one if terminal application supports it (for scroll stuff).
- [ ] Start building the damn bookmarking application that I wanted in the first place.
